/* Dual-domain schedule for Kata to isolate third party applications from system
 * applications.
 *
 * Note that this doesn't actually implement the schedule -- that's hardwired in
 * seL4's kernel source. See also kata/kernel/src/kernel/thread.c, in the
 * nextDomain function around line 302 and the timerTick function around 630.
 *
 * Effectively this is a round-robin scheduler, so half of the CPU time is given
 * to system applications, while third party applications are allocated the
 * other half. Note that even if there's nothing to run in the third-party
 * application domain, the scheduler will schedule an idle thread to ensure that
 * domain gets it's allocated share of time.
